Came up with this in Brisbane, has evolved a bit. Sometimes use some salami along with the prosciutto if I can find a good salami to match.

Typically service it with a Moscato.

### Steps:

1. Prep by Roughly chopping Olives, Sundried Tomatoes, and Prosciutto
2. Get that salted water boiling for the pasta
3. Warm up a skillet, and throw chopped pine nuts in until lightly roasted then remove
4. Take 1/2 - 3/4 of the prosciutto and place in skillet on low -> medium heat. Remove once slightly crispy
5. Chicken into a skillet on medium-high (Depending on amount of chicken and liquid content of chicken)
6. Throw the linguine in (We should be wrapped up the rest by the time this cooks, remove 1 minute to spare so we can finish with the other ingredients)
7. Once chicken has ~2 minutes left to cook, add Olives, Sundried Tomatoes and the pre-cooked proscuitto
8. After a minute, add spinach and make sure it wilts its way down
9. Pasta ontop of any unwilted spinach + some pasta water
10. Toss until pasta is close to done, take off the heat and add remaining fresh prosciutto
11. Serve in a bowl, add peppered avocado to the top, drizzle with balsamic if preferred.
